					<span style={{ color: "#38B553" }}>SuperGig</span> started as an idea by a group of Web Developers.
					We were all a part of a coding bootcamp during the summer of 2020. We are a group of different
					people with the same common purpose #LearnToCode. Together we collaborated to make this Project a
					reality. As you may know COVID-19 was rampant during this time of the year. Many of us had friends
					and/or family members lose their jobs due to the pandemic.
					<br />
					<br />
					This fueled our idea and drove us to create a web-app where anyone could log-in, post short-terms
					jobs that they needed assistance with. Also, those looking for jobs, after being pre-qualified,
					could post their job-skills, offer their services to the public, and be hired by anyone who may need
					such service. This theory seemed to work great because many members of the community are struggling
					during these times, any small job that they can complete will benefit themselves as well as their
					family. Also, many community-members might not have the funds to hire a company that will
					potentially charge hundreds of dollars for a simple job which their neighbor could possibly do for
					less.
					<br />
					<br />
					<span style={{ color: "#38B553" }}>SuperGig</span> is from the community and for the community.

						I am a wife and a mother of two children, I studied Advertising and have worked in Marketing
						ever since. I became interested in coding by seeing my brother code. A dear friend once told me
						that if I knew Excel I could learn. From that day the story changed, I now love coding! It has
						cost me a lot of work, time, and sacrifices but I will not be content until I achieve my goal.
						For this, I must constantly keep learning and practicing. I was the least technological person
						in the world so if I can do it anyone can.

					<p className="aboutUs-creator-three-description">
						I am a recent coding bootcamp graduate. I first became interested in programing at the age of 13
						trying to develop a game in Python. I didnt have any proper guidance, so I became discouraged.
						One day my step-father who is a cyber security specialist reintroduced me to the world of
						coding, and I was hooked. After that I joined the 4Geeks coding bootcamp, I met likeminded
						individuals who were also persuing a career in web development and realized the growth and
						potential of the industry. I know now this is what I want to do.
